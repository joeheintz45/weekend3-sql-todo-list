# To Do Maker

## Description

I had to create a Task maker that had a delete function and a complete function. I started by making a simple database with a task table. I then wrote a server script that accessed the database with a GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE route. Once I established the routes functionality, I started by making a simple HTML file with an input field and table for listing the tasks. I then wrote some JS for accessing the routes and appending, deleting, and completing the data. Once the functionality was complete, I added Bootstrap stylings to improve look of the page. I also added a Sweet Alert confirmation modal to ask the user if they are sure if they want to delete the task.

## Usage

- First a user creates a task
- Once a task is completed they can complete the task by hitting the green complete button
- They can also delete the task
- Repeat

## Built With
